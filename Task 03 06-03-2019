			Our inspiration sprouts from the desire to bring back the balance in the ecosystem.
			Honeybees have inhabited our planet for around 3.5 million years and since then they have been an inseparable
			part of nature. Moreover, they are the most reliable and easy to manage pollinator and for this reason they 
			have been positioned well into the center of the agriculture industry. We rely on 30% of all our food to be pollinated
			by the honeybees and we must protect and cherish them. Bees are responsible for the future of our food!
